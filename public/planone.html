										<p><span>&nbsp;this lack of foresight has lasting ramifications that can last decades</span></p>
										<p><span>Discuss:</span></p>
										<p><span>Teacher: Why do you think the manufacturers do this?&nbsp;</span></p>

										<p><span> Impacts of Plastic Pollution</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Every year unused fishing gear, is discarded in the ocean causing serious marine issues.:</span></p>
										<p><span>This gear is referred to as Ghost Gear, and it often cannot be removed or disappear from the ocean without human interference. For example:</span></p>
										<ul>
												<li aria-level="1">
														<p><span>Example 1</span></p>
												</li>
												<li aria-level="1">
														<p><span>Example 2</span></p>

										<p><span>What options are being taken to combat this issue?.&nbsp;</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>*** Ghost Gear Recovery ***&nbsp;</span></p>
										<p><span>Discuss:</span></p>
										<p><span>Teacher: What do you think of the impacts of ghost gear on the ocean?</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Notes:</span></p>
										<p><span>Recycling or Lack thereof:&nbsp;</span></p>
										<p><span>Unreusable materials</span><span>make up a surprising amount of the plastics that are used in production, for example&nbsp;</span></p><br/>
										<ol>

										<p><span>The line between what can and cannot be reused is often unclear &nbsp;</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Sometimes a material can be ok if it is reused and responsibly recycled </span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Sometimes no matter what we do it will create lasting waste</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Often even materials that can be ok end up being apart of the issue</span></p>
										<p><span>Discuss:</span></p>
										<p><span>Teacher: Sustainable Materials vs. Unsustainable Materials: Where are they used?</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Sustainable Materials: Materials that can be safely used that do not cause lasting harm, or can be reused without harm or impact. &nbsp;</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Unsustainable : matarials and practices that cause lasting harm and pollution to the environment and everyday lives &nbsp;</span></p><br/>
										<p><span>Discuss:&nbsp;</span></p>
										<p><span>Teacher: I am handing out a Venn diagram, Venn diagrams allow you to visually compare two topics, it also helps you to identify similarities. Today I would like you to compare and contrast the areas where different materials are used and where you think they are or are not recyclable.&nbsp;</span></p>
										<p><span>Teacher: You have the rest of class to work on completing your Venn diagram. Venn diagrams allow you to visually compare two topics, it also allows you to identify similarities. I would like you fill out at least 3 reasons on each side and at least one similarity&nbsp;</span></p>
